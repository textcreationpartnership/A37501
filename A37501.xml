            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Vniformity Examined.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Bserving that our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> judgement, do often both in their Discourse and writings, exceedingly press for <hi>Æ²niformity;</hi> I have been urged in my spirit, to think upon the matter, and to consider whether there could be any such thing found in the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> or in the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Churches of Christ.</hi> And for my part, I ingenuously profess, I cannot yet disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and would be glad if any would instruct me further in this particular, so he do it from the <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Æ²niformity</hi> what is it, but an <hi>unity of form?</hi> and the <hi>form</hi> they mean, no doubt, is <hi>outward:</hi> for the <hi>inward</hi> form, as it cannot be known by the outward senses; so neither can it be accomplished by <hi>outward power.</hi> And therefore (till I know their meaning better) I conceive that by <hi>uniformity</hi> they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand an <hi>unity of outward form</hi> in the Churches of God: yea, some of them do declare so much, calling the thing they would have, <hi>External Æ²niformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now such a thing as this (after so much meditation and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, as my other imployments, and the many distractions that necessarily attend my present condition, will permit me) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern, in the Word of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For Christ speaking of the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> saith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. <hi>The hour cometh and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41514:3"/>in Spirit and Truth, for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> In which words it is most evident, that the <hi>worship of God</hi> in the time of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> is <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> consisting in faith, hope, love, and in prayer, which is the operation of the three former, &amp;c. And so, is so far from <hi>Æ²niformity</hi> as it hath been <hi>explicated,</hi> and as they <hi>understand</hi> it, that it is not at all <hi>capable</hi> of it. And therefore I cannot but <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,</hi> at the strange workings of darkness in the minds of men, who would have an exernal <hi>Æ²niformity,</hi> in a worship that is <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> and of which, the <hi>outward form</hi> is no part at all, but is meerly <hi>accidental,</hi> and so absolutely <hi>various.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as I finde not this <hi>Æ²niformity,</hi> in the <hi>doctrine of the Gospel,</hi> so neither in the <hi>practice of the Saints,</hi> who had the spirit of the Gospel, as that <hi>practice</hi> is represented to us, in the <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. I read, how the <hi>Apostles</hi> being together with the women, and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Jesus, and his brethren, <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <hi>with one accord or mind in prayer and supplication:</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>&amp;</hi> 46. how <hi>all that believed were together, and continued daily</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>with one minde in the Temple, and did break bread from house to house, &amp;c.</hi> And in all this there was <hi>Æ²nity,</hi> but no <hi>external Æ²niformity,</hi> neither <hi>name</hi> not <hi>thing.</hi> Again, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.23. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being let go by the Magistrates, <hi>went to their own company</hi> (which many of our Clergy would term a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle) <hi>and reported all that the chief Priests and Elders had said to them; and when they heard it, they lift up their voice to God,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with one mind, and prayed.</hi> Here was <hi>inward Æ²nity,</hi> in faith, and love, and joy, and spiritual prayer, but no <hi>external Æ²ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity:</hi> and vers 32. <hi>The multitude of them that believed, were of one heart, and one soul. Æ²nity</hi> still, but nothing of <hi>external Æ²niformity.</hi> Further, we read <hi>Acts</hi> chap. 7. and chap. 8 that <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> who by the <hi>Church</hi> were ordained <hi>Deacons,</hi> and were to serve only for the Ministery of the Table, yet by vertue of the <hi>anointing,</hi> preached the Word of God freely, and powerfully: and how <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Members</hi> of the Church of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> who were neither <hi>Ministers</hi> not <hi>Deacons,</hi> being scattered abroad by Persecution, went <hi>Preaching</hi> the Word everywhere, where they came, in that case of necessity: the unction of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41514:3"/>
               <hi>Spirit</hi> of which all Believers partake alike, being one <hi>fundamental</hi> ground of such <hi>Ministery,</hi> where there are no <hi>Believers</hi> to call to the Office: and in this, though there was <hi>unity</hi> of faith, spirit, and doctrine, yet I am sure they will say, there was no such <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> as they would have. Again, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>Paul</hi> the first day of the Week, preached to the Disciples of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> from the Evening till Midnight (which Dr. <hi>Pocklington</hi> in a printed Sermon saith, was <hi>out of order,</hi> that is, out of <hi>Prelatical order,</hi> or <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Æ²niformity</hi>) and after brake bread, and did eat, and talked with them a long while, till <hi>break of day:</hi> and going from thence, he arrived at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and there called the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Chuch together, and appeals to them after what manner he had been with them, to wit, <hi>serving the Lord with all humility of minde, and with many tears and temptations,</hi> &amp;c. and how, <hi>he had held back nothing profitable for them, but had taught them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and from house to house</hi> (which I wish were more in use now-a-dayes, if it might obtain so much leave from <hi>Æ²niformity</hi>) <hi>and had preached to them Repentance towards God, and Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> our chief work towards <hi>God</hi> since our fall and corruption being <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is the change of the creature towards God, through Gods own work in the creature: and this is not done without the sorrow of the flesh; and our chief work towards <hi>Christ,</hi> who is given to us as a head, being <hi>Faith</hi> or Union. And in the end, exhorts the <hi>Presbyters, to take heed to themselves</hi> (who according to the Church principles of this age, want no admonition <hi>themselves,</hi> seeing they are become a <hi>peremptory</hi> rule to all <hi>others</hi>) <hi>and to the flocks over which the holy Spirit</hi> (and not Patrons) <hi>had made them Over-seers, to feed the Church of God, which he had purchased with his own blood, &amp;c.</hi> But in <hi>all</hi> this, neither <hi>practices</hi> himself, nor <hi>preaches</hi> to them, nor <hi>commands</hi> them to preach to others, or impose upon others, any such kind of thing as <hi>external uniformity.</hi> And so surely, they that so vehemently urge this thing, that they make it <hi>all in all,</hi> in their <hi>Reformation,</hi> have some other teacher then the <hi>Apostle,</hi> who being taught of <hi>Christ,</hi> as Christ was taught of <hi>God,</hi> yet knew no such thing at all, in the <hi>worship</hi> of God as <hi>Æ²niformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet further, that the <hi>world</hi> (if it be possible) may be the more convinced, observe a little more seriously the practice of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> in reference to this point, and you shall see
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41514:4"/>nothing less then <hi>external Æ²niformity.</hi> See this in the <hi>prayer of Christ,</hi> (<hi>Prayer</hi> for the duty it self, being nothing, but so much <hi>spiritual</hi> worship, as being the voyce of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>flesh,</hi> both in <hi>head</hi> &amp; <hi>members</hi>) <hi>This,</hi> Christ sometimes performed, with his <hi>eyes</hi> lifted up to Heaven, sometimes being prostrate with his <hi>body</hi> on the Earth, and <hi>so several</hi> times, <hi>several</hi> wayes: and as he, so the <hi>Saints,</hi> have; <hi>some</hi> prayed standing, &amp; lifting up their hands, as <hi>Moses; some,</hi> kneeling and lifting up their hands, as <hi>Solomon; some,</hi> standing and not lifting up their eyes, as the <hi>Publican,</hi> &amp;c. And what <hi>external Æ²niformity</hi> in all this? And as for <hi>Praying,</hi> so for <hi>Preaching;</hi> Christ sometimes preached in a <hi>ship,</hi> sometimes on the <hi>shoar,</hi> sometimes in the <hi>City Jerusalem,</hi> sometimes in the <hi>Temple,</hi> sometimes in the <hi>Desart,</hi> sometimes <hi>early,</hi> sometimes <hi>late,</hi> as if he intended on <hi>purpose,</hi> to witness, against that piece of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> which in after Ages should be called <hi>Æ²ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> preached sometimes on the <hi>Jews Sabbath,</hi> sometimes on the <hi>first day</hi> of the week, sometimes <hi>each day</hi> of the week, sometimes in the <hi>day,</hi> sometimes in the <hi>night;</hi> sometimes prayed in the <hi>house,</hi> sometimes on the <hi>shoar:</hi> he circumcised <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> among the <hi>weak,</hi> refused to circumcise <hi>Titus</hi> among the <hi>perverse,</hi> became as a <hi>Jew</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a <hi>Greek</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to the <hi>weak</hi> as <hi>weak,</hi> to the <hi>strong</hi> as <hi>strong,</hi> all things to all men, that he might win some: and what <hi>external Æ²niformity</hi> was here? And then for the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> Christ administred the Sacrament of the <hi>Supper,</hi> immediately <hi>after Supper; Paul</hi> at <hi>midnight,</hi> and it may be others in the <hi>morning,</hi> or at <hi>noone:</hi> and what <hi>external Æ²niformity</hi> in all this? And for <hi>Government;</hi> sometimes the <hi>Apostles</hi> met together into a <hi>Councel,</hi> and in that Councel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered things not of their <hi>own heads,</hi> or by <hi>plurality of voyces,</hi> but by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> and what they <hi>ordered</hi> by the Word and Spirit, they put in <hi>execution</hi> by the power of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not by the power of the <hi>World.</hi> At other times, <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> and <hi>Believers,</hi> did things by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> among themselves, by the mutual consent of <hi>both;</hi> or else <hi>Believers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone among themselves, if there were no <hi>Ministers</hi> present. And where the <hi>number</hi> of Believers were <hi>more,</hi> they stood in need of <hi>more</hi> Officers: and where <hi>fewer,</hi> of <hi>fewer</hi> Officers; and all these things, are the <hi>free</hi> ordering of the <hi>Churches,</hi> who have <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> among them, and in them, and so are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41514:4"/>taken out of the <hi>bondage</hi> of men, into the <hi>freedom</hi> of God. That truly I see not the <hi>Gospel,</hi> more setting its <hi>spirit,</hi> against any thing of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> then against this point of <hi>external uniformity.</hi> For if we have <hi>one</hi> Lord, Christ, Spirit, Faith, Baptism, and God, all other things are <hi>free</hi> to the Churches, as <hi>God</hi> shall order by them, and no otherwise; and the reason, and wisdom, and prudence of <hi>man,</hi> have no place in <hi>this</hi> world, where the <hi>Sun of righteousness</hi> shines, as the only light?</p>
            <p>But against this that hath been said, do lie some <hi>objections;</hi> as first,</p>
            <p>The Prophet foretold that <hi>the Lord should be one, and his name one,</hi> and doth not this imply <hi>external uniformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, nothing less: for the <hi>Apostle</hi> explicates plainly and clearly, what it is to have the <hi>Lord one,</hi> and his <hi>name one,</hi> among believers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>ch.</hi> 4.5.6. where he saith, there is in the spiritual Church, <hi>one Body, and one Spirit, one hope of our calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and father of all, who is above all, through all, and in all.</hi> Where you see, that among believers, there is a <hi>manifold unity,</hi> but no <hi>external uniformity;</hi> yea the prayer of <hi>Christ the Son,</hi> for the Church, unfolds clearly the promise of <hi>God the Father</hi> to the Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. Christ prays, <hi>that they all</hi> (who are <hi>many</hi> among themselves, according to the <hi>flesh</hi>) <hi>may be one as thou Father art in me, and I in thee,</hi> (that is according to the <hi>unity</hi> of the Spirit, not <hi>external uniformity</hi>) <hi>that after this manner they also may be one in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again it is objected out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that <hi>all things may be done in the Church decently and in order:</hi> and doth not this imply <hi>external uniformity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that they will hardly admit in their <hi>Parish Churches,</hi> such a <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>order.</hi> as the Apostle there means, neither are they <hi>capable</hi> of it. For he saith before, <hi>When the whole Church is come together into some place, that all may prophesie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted:</hi> and that during this exercise of prophesying, <hi>if any thing be revealed to another, the former to give place;</hi> and <hi>he</hi> must speak that hath the <hi>clearest</hi> light, seeing the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to whomsoever it is given, it is given to <hi>profit withall.</hi> And that though <hi>all</hi> may prophesie <hi>one by one,</hi> yet all may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie at <hi>once,</hi> for then it would not be <hi>order, but confusion,</hi> which the Apostle would have avoided, saying, <hi>Let all things be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and in order.</hi> And <hi>this</hi> decency too, he <hi>perswades</hi> to by the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41514:5"/>
               <hi>word,</hi> he doth not <hi>enforce</hi> by <hi>secular power:</hi> And if they will call this <hi>uniformity,</hi> for beleevers to prophesie one after another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>variety</hi> of the gifts of the Spirit, and not many, or two or three at once, or the same time, we willingly agree with them: but how far <hi>this</hi> thing, is from <hi>their</hi> sence, every one knows.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, these <hi>objections</hi> answered, and I am confident there are no more can be brought, but may as clearly and easily be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered as these.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I say, I <hi>wonder,</hi> and wonder again, that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>covenanted</hi> and agreed together solemnly, to endeavour for a <hi>Government</hi> most agreeable to the <hi>word of God,</hi> should in the mean time, be left so void, of the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of the Gospel, as to fall upon <hi>external uniformity,</hi> which is nowhere to be found in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor in the <hi>practise</hi> of primitive Christians.</p>
            <p>Yea, while I consider more seriously of the Matter, me thinks <hi>external uniformity</hi> is a monstrous thing, (how glorious soever in their eyes) and not to be found either in <hi>nature</hi> or in <hi>grace,</hi> either in <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom, or the Kingdoms of the <hi>world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In nature</hi> is no <hi>external uniformity</hi> extended to all the works of nature; for look into the <hi>world,</hi> and see if there be not <hi>variety</hi> of forms; <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>earthly</hi> bodies, having several form; and in the <hi>earth,</hi> each bird, beast, tree, plant, creature, <hi>differs</hi> one from another, in <hi>outward form.</hi> If the <hi>whole</hi> creation, should appear in <hi>one form,</hi> or <hi>external uniformity,</hi> what a <hi>monstrous</hi> thing would it be, nothing differing from the <hi>first chaos?</hi> But the <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>forms</hi> in the world is the <hi>beauty</hi> of the world: So that though there be a most <hi>admirable unity</hi> among all the creatures, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less then <hi>external uniformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as there is no <hi>external uniformity</hi> spread over the <hi>great world,</hi> so nor yet over the <hi>little world,</hi> or <hi>man.</hi> For look upon a man, consisting of <hi>head</hi> and <hi>members,</hi> unto which the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the <hi>Church,</hi> and you shall not finde all the members like one another, neither in regard of their <hi>outward forms,</hi> nor <hi>operations:</hi> for the <hi>hand,</hi> doth not move as the <hi>foot,</hi> nor the <hi>foot</hi> act as the <hi>hand;</hi> and if all the members should appear and act in <hi>one form,</hi> what a <hi>monster</hi> would a man be? And yet among the members, though there be no <hi>external uniformity,</hi> yet there is <hi>admirable unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet again, look into the Kingdoms of the <hi>world,</hi> and you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41514:5"/>shall see no such thing in them as <hi>external uniformity:</hi> Here in <hi>England</hi> you shall observe that <hi>York</hi> is not governed as <hi>Hull,</hi> nor <hi>Hull</hi> as <hi>Hallifax,</hi> nor that as <hi>Bristol, &amp;c.</hi> neither is one <hi>County,</hi> governed <hi>uniformly</hi> as another; there is no <hi>uniformity</hi> in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex;</hi> nor one <hi>town,</hi> governed like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in <hi>Godmanchester,</hi> the <hi>youngest</hi> son inherits, in <hi>Huntington</hi> the <hi>Eldest:</hi> nor one <hi>Corporation</hi> governed like another, nor one <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> in the City governed as another; and yet between all Counties, Cities, Towns, Corporations, Companies, there is <hi>unity,</hi> though no <hi>external uniformity.</hi> Yea, look upon the famous City of <hi>London,</hi> and there are, it may be, an hundred thousand <hi>families,</hi> or more in it, and each one governed after a <hi>several</hi> manner, and among all these families, there is no <hi>external uniformity,</hi> and yet they all agree well enough, in the <hi>unity</hi> of a <hi>City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay further, to bring but <hi>one man,</hi> to an <hi>uniformity</hi> of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> by an outward Law, would be the most absolute <hi>tyranny</hi> in the world, and make his life worse then death. To compel every man by a <hi>law</hi> every <hi>day</hi> in the week, or every <hi>Munday, Tuseday,</hi> &amp;c. in the week, to an <hi>uniformity</hi> of life, that he shall <hi>rise</hi> at the same time, use the same <hi>postures,</hi> speak the same <hi>words,</hi> eat the same <hi>food,</hi> receive the same <hi>physick,</hi> sit, and stand, and walk, and lie-down at the same set times, who ever heard of such a cruel bondage? What an <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>intolerable</hi> thing then is <hi>uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in the life of a <hi>man,</hi> taking away all <hi>freedom</hi> of the soul? But how much more evil and intolerable is <hi>uniformity</hi> in the life of a <hi>Christian,</hi> or of the true Churches of Christ, taking away all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> who being <hi>one</hi> with God, works in the <hi>freedom</hi> of God, and is not to be <hi>bound,</hi> with any authoritative or coercive power, of poor, dark, ignorant, vain, foolish, proud, and sinful men?</p>
            <p>What now then do the <hi>Presbyters</hi> mean by <hi>uniformity?</hi> Would they have the word preached, and the Sacraments administred, and the name of God called on, and all this done in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> in the Churches of Christ? this truly is <hi>unity</hi> and not <hi>uniformity,</hi> and such an <hi>unity</hi> as no man can <hi>compel.</hi> But would they have, the Word preached, the name of God called on, Sacraments admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, the spiritual Discipline of the spiritual Church mannaged, the vertues of Christ, and graces of the Spirit in the Saints exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and all this in one and the same <hi>outward form,</hi> or <hi>uniformity?</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:41514:6"/>This is the burthen of the Saints, the bondage of the Church, the straitning of the Spirit, the limiting of Christ, and the eclipsing the glory of the Father. And how <hi>wise</hi> so ever, these men may be, in natural and carnal things: yet their <hi>wisdom,</hi> is but <hi>foolishness</hi> in spiritual things, in which there is no more <hi>uniformity,</hi> then in the <hi>workings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> who works <hi>severally,</hi> in <hi>several</hi> Saints, and <hi>severally,</hi> in the <hi>same</hi> Saints, at <hi>several</hi> times: And therefore they that would tye the <hi>Church</hi> to an <hi>uniformity,</hi> which works not of it self, but as the <hi>Spirit</hi> works in it, let them first tye the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to an <hi>uniformity,</hi> and we are contented. But these men, seem to run a sad hazard, who would thus reduce the workings of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in Christians and Churches, to an <hi>outward uniformity,</hi> according to their own <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>fancy,</hi> and so would rule and order, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and straiten the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> by the <hi>spirit of man,</hi> seeing it is worse, to sin against Christ in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> then against Christ in the <hi>flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, till I be otherwise taught by the <hi>word,</hi> I cannot conceive that there <hi>ought</hi> to be, or is <hi>possible</hi> to be, any such <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal uniformity,</hi> in the Churches of Christ, as these men strive, wrastle, sweat, contend for, I will not say are ready to fight for: but that <hi>several</hi> Churches of Christ, having <hi>unity</hi> of doctrine, faith, the Spirit, ordinances, &amp;c. may have <hi>divers forms,</hi> of outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, as God and Christ by the Spirit shall lead them; and that every Church, is in these things to be left <hi>free</hi> and no Church <hi>forced,</hi> by any <hi>outward power,</hi> to follow or imitate another Church, against its <hi>will,</hi> not being <hi>freely</hi> led unto it, by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>Neither do I think, that God hath set up, any <hi>company</hi> of men, or <hi>Synod</hi> in the world, to shine to a <hi>whole Nation,</hi> so that all People shall be <hi>constrained</hi> to follow <hi>their</hi> judgement, and to walk by <hi>their</hi> light, seeing <hi>other Ministers</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> may have <hi>more</hi> light and spirit, then <hi>they.</hi> Neither hath <hi>Christ,</hi> promised his presence and spirit, to <hi>Ministers</hi> more then to <hi>believers,</hi> nor more to an <hi>hundred,</hi> then <hi>two or three:</hi> And if <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the Country, being met together in the <hi>name</hi> of Christ, have <hi>Christ</hi> himself, with his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> among them, they need not <hi>ride</hi> many miles to the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>London</hi> to know <hi>what</hi> to do, or <hi>how</hi> to carry and behave themselves, in the <hi>things</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And therefore, for any company of men, of what <hi>repute</hi> soever, to set up their <hi>own judgement</hi> in a Kingdom, for a <hi>peremptory rule,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41514:6"/>from which no <hi>man</hi> must vary, and to <hi>compel</hi> all the faithful people of God, who are the very <hi>members</hi> of Jesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to <hi>fall down</hi> before it, upon pain of being cast into the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fiery furnace of their indignation, heated seven times more hot then ordinary, through the desired access of <hi>secular power</hi> to their power, is a far <hi>worse</hi> work, in my eyes, then that of King <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi> setting up a <hi>golden Image,</hi> and <hi>forcing</hi> all to fall down before it; seeing <hi>spiritual</hi> Idolatry, is so much <hi>worse</hi> then <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> as the spirit is <hi>better</hi> then the flesh.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do think (let them teach me better by the <hi>word</hi> that can) that <hi>uniformity</hi> (the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> and the Image that falls down from the <hi>brain</hi> and <hi>fancy</hi> of man) hath no footing in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or in the <hi>practise</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Christ:</hi> And that the <hi>Presbyterian uniformity,</hi> is neer a kin to <hi>Prelatical conformity,</hi> and is no other then the <hi>same thing,</hi> under <hi>another word,</hi> after the manner of <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery;</hi> and do conclude, that <hi>unity</hi> is Christian, <hi>uniformity</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
            <p>And this I have only <hi>hinted,</hi> and that briefly, among many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, to discover to the faithfull, that some of the very <hi>dregs</hi> of <hi>Antichristianisme,</hi> still prevail and domineer, under the very name of <hi>Reformation:</hi> And also to give occasion, to men of more spirit, and abilities, and leisure, to discourse more fully to this point, that the Serpents head of <hi>Formality,</hi> which is so carefully nourished by <hi>humane reason,</hi> may be crushed in pieces by the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>word.</hi>
